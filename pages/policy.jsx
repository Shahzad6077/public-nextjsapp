          <p className="text-sm text-termsP">
            As a registered user of Egowall, you can review the personal
            information you provided to us and make any desired changes to the
            information you publish, or to the settings for your Egowall account
            including your email and contact preferences, at any time by logging
            in to your account on the Egowall website. Please be aware that even
            after your request for a change is processed, Egowall may, for a

            will no longer be able to visit your homes, but we do not delete any
            of your information. Deactivating an account is the same as you
            telling us not to delete any information because you might want to
            reactivate your account at some point in the future. You can
            deactivate your account on your account settings page.

            In order to help secure your personal information, access to your
            data on Egowall is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as
            credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is
            exchanged between your web browser and the Egowall website. To
            protect any data you store on our servers, Egowall also regularly
            audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we
            use a tier-one secured-access data center. However, since the
            internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or
            warrant the security of any information you transmit to Egowall.
            There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed,
            disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
